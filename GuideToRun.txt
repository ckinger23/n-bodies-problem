How I ran and compiled upc_nbody.c:

I tested a bunch of different data distributions, which I made a word doc to
represent the code differences and result times, but the best time I received
came from the most boring layout where the affinity was just "i" and the bodies
and next array were not divided into blocks.

I was compiling with:
$ make threads=20 all

running:
srun -N 2 -n 2 --ntasks-per-thread=10 ./lab3.20

  This got me a final time of apprximately 230,000 ms.

upc_attempt.c:
  I gave it a shot to try and use memput into a local array in order to get the
  communication to be utilized through block movement instead of a ton of small
  communications, but I could not figure it out.
